Open Source Pick and Place Electronic Feeder Hardware / Software, Verison #1.0.0 (alpha)

Introduction
---------------------

OpenFeeder is a project to create the plans, prototype, hardware and software for a completely Open Source (Non Commercial License) SMT pick and place machine electronic feeder system that is both flexible and affordable. All components attempt to utilize 2d sheet metal parts and / or 3d printed parts. Electronic components including motors, sensors, etc are commercially available items aside from a custom circuit board(s) to control the feeder.

Project Status
---------------------

Overall, the project is in an pre-alpha state. This means that itâ€™s under heavy development with no prototype work completed to date. 

If you would like to keep up with our progress you can Watch this project on GitHub.
